Here, we have the data we'll be using:
CollegeScoreCardDataDictionary.csv - descriptions of each column
cols_using.csv - A subset of CollegeScoreCardDataDictionary.csv giving us only
	the columns we want.
FullDataDocumentation.pdf - Exactly what the name is
sub_dat - A subset of the original data including only the variables from cols_using,
	but also only instances where our response, MD_EARN_WNE_P6 was non-null
